# refine

### Refine your file collection using Rust!

## What it does

This is a tool that will scan any given paths, and run some command on them.

The `dupes` command will analyze and report the possibly duplicated files, both by size and name.
It will even load a sample from each file, in order to guarantee they are indeed duplicated.

The new `rebuild` command is a marvel of engineering! If I say so myself.
It will rebuild the filenames of your entire collection!

It is blazingly fast and tiny, made 100% in Rust ü¶Ä!

In the future, this tool could make much more, like for instance moving duplicated files, including
a GUI to enable easily acting upon them, etc., hence the open name `refine`...

## How it works

### The `dupes` command

1. recursively detect all files in the given paths (excluding hidden .folders)
    - can optionally run only a shallow scan too.
2. sort all the files by their sizes and by their words
    - the word extractor ignores repetition systems like -1, -2, and copy, copy 2.
3. for each group with the exact same value, a sample of each file will be retrieved and compared
4. each coincidence will be listed as possible duplicates:

```
-- by size

132.1kB x3
/Users/you/Downloads/path/file.ext
/Users/you/Downloads/another-path/other.any
/Volumes/External/backup-path/back.001

248.6MB x2
/Users/you/Downloads/video.mp4
/Volumes/External/backup-path/video.mpg.bak

-- by name

["bin", "cache", "query"] x2
904.2kB: ./target/debug/incremental/refine-1uzt8yoeb0t1e/s-gx7knsxvbx-1oc90bk-working/query-cache.bin
904.9kB: ./target/debug/incremental/refine-1uzt8yoeb0t1e/s-gx7knwsqka-w784iw-6s3nzkfcj1wxagnjubj1pm4v6/query-cache.bin

```

And, finally, a brief receipt will be printed:

```
total files: 13512
  by size: 339 duplicates
  by name: 12 duplicates
```

### The `rebuild` command

1. strip parts of the filenames, either before or after some matches, or exact ones in the middle;
2. remove all sequence numbers they might have, like "copy 2" or "-3";
3. smartly remove spaces and underscores to detect misspelled names;
4. group the names according to the rest;
5. smartly choose the most likely correct name among the group;
6. sort the group entries by created date;
7. regenerate a unified sequence with this new order; <-- Note this occurs on the whole group,
   regardless
   of the directory the file resides!
8. renames the files to the new pattern.

```
/Users/you/Downloads/path/file.mp4 --> file-1.mp4
/Users/you/Downloads/path/video ok.mp4 --> video__ok-1.mp4
/Users/you/Downloads/another-path/video_ok.mp4 --> video__ok-2.mp4
/Volumes/External/backup-path/Video__OK.mp4 --> video__ok-3.mp4
/Users/you/Downloads/another-path/video not ok.mp4 --> video_not_ok-1.mp4
```

And, finally, a brief receipt will be printed:

```
total files: 21126
  changes: 1432
```

## How to use it

Install with `cargo install refine`, then just:

```bash
‚ùØ refine dupes ~/Downloads /Volumes/Drive ...
```

Or:

```bash
‚ùØ refine rebuild ~/Downloads /Volumes/Drive ...
```

Send as many sources as you want.
