# files
### Files deduplication in Rust!

## What it does

This is a simple tool that will scan some given paths, and report the possibly duplicated files.

It is blazingly fast, since it is in Rust, and tiny.

In the future, it could make more than just detecting duplicates, like for example renaming files, hence the name just `files`.

## How it works

It will:
- recursively detect all files in the given paths (excluding hidden .folders and .files)
- sort all the files by their sizes
- for each group with the exact same size, a sample of each file will be retrieved and compared
- each same size/same sample group will be listed as a possible duplicate:

```
132.1 KB
/Users/you/Downloads/path/file.ext
/Users/you/Downloads/another-path/other.any
/Volumes/External/backup-path/back.001

248.6 MB
/Users/you/Downloads/video.mp4
/Volumes/External/backup-path/video.mpg.bak

...
```

- and finally, a brief receipt will be printed:
```
total files: 13512 (1567 duplicates)
```

## How to use it

```bash
‚ùØ cargo run ~/Downloads /Volumes/Drive ...
```

Send as many sources as you want.
