### Refine your file collection using Rust!

## What it does

This is the tool that will help you manage your file collection! It will scan some given paths and analyze all files, performing some advanced operations on them, such as finding possibly duplicated files, or even automatically grouping and rebuilding their filenames (according to your rules)!

The `dupes` command will analyze and report the possibly duplicated files, either by size or name. It will even load a sample from each file, in order to guarantee they are indeed duplicated. It is a small sample by default but can help reduce false positives a lot, and you can increase it if you want.

The `rebuild` command is a great achievement, if I say so myself. It will smartly rebuild the filenames of your entire collection by stripping parts of filenames you don't want, removing any sequence numbers, smartly detecting misspelled names by comparing with adjacent files, sorting the detected groups deterministically by creation date, regenerating sequence numbers, and finally renaming all these files! It's awesome to quickly find your video or music library neatly sorted automatically... And the next time you run it, since it is deterministic, it will only detect the new files added since the last time. Pretty cool, huh? And don't worry, you can review all the changes before applying them.

The `list` command will gather all the files in the given paths, sort them by name, size, or path, and display them in a friendly format.

It is blazingly fast and tiny, made 100% in Rust ü¶Ä!

In the future, this tool could make much more, like for instance moving duplicated files, renaming files without rebuilding everything, perhaps supporting aliases for names, including a GUI to enable easily acting upon files, etc., hence the open `refine` (your filesystem) name...

## New in 0.10

- global: new --exclude option to exclude files

<details><summary>Previous changes</summary>

## New in 0.9

- new support for Ctrl-C, to abort all operations and gracefully exit the program at any time.
    - all commands will stop collecting files when Ctrl-C is pressed
    - both `dupes` and `list` command will show partial results
    - the `rebuild` command will just exit, as it needs all the files to run

## New in 0.8

- new "list" command

## New in 0.7

- global: new --include option to filter input files
- rebuild: new --force option to easily rename new files
- rebuild: new interactive mode by default, making --dry_run obsolete (removed), with new --yes option to bypass it (good for automation)
- rebuild: auto fix renaming errors
- dupes: faster performance by ignoring groups with 1 file (thus avoiding loading samples)
- rebuild: smaller memory consumption by caching file extensions

</details>

## How to use it

Install `refine` with:

```
cargo install refine
```

That's it, and you can then just call it anywhere!

## Commands

All commands will:

1. recursively scan all the given paths (excluding hidden .folders)
    - can optionally perform only a shallow scan
    - can optionally filter files based on two regexes (include and exclude)
2. load the metadata the command requires to run (e.g. file size, creation date, etc.) for each file
3. execute the command and print the results

Commands:
  dupes    Find possibly duplicated files by both size and filename
  rebuild  Rebuild the filenames of collections of files intelligently
  list     List files from the given paths
  help     Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version

Global:
  -i, --include <REGEX>  Include these files; tested against filename+extension, case-insensitive
  -x, --exclude <REGEX>  Exclude these files; tested against filename+extension, case-insensitive

  [PATHS]...         Paths to scan

For more information, see https://github.com/rsalmei/refine
```

</details>

### The `dupes` command

1. group all the files by size
2. for each group with the exact same value, load a sample of its files
3. compare the samples with each other and find possible duplicates
4. group all the files by words in their names
    - the word extractor ignores sequence numbers like file-1, file copy, file-3 copy 2, etc.
5. run 2. and 3. again, and print the results

<details><summary>Command help</summary>

```
Find possibly duplicated files by both size and filename

Usage: refine dupes [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...

Options:
  -s, --sample <BYTES>  Sample size in bytes (0 to disable) [default: 2048]
  -c, --case            Case-sensitive file name comparison
  -h, --help            Print help

Global:
  -i, --include <REGEX>  Include these files; tested against filename+extension, case-insensitive
  -x, --exclude <REGEX>  Exclude these files; tested against filename+extension, case-insensitive
      --shallow          Do not recurse into subdirectories
  [PATHS]...         Paths to scan
```

Example:

```
‚ùØ refine dupes ~/Downloads /Volumes/External --sample 20480
Refine: vX.X.X
Detecting duplicate files...
  - sample bytes: 20kB
  - match case: false

-- by size

...

total files: 13512
  by size: 339 duplicates
  by name: 42 duplicates
```

### The `rebuild` command

1. remove any sequence numbers like file-1, file copy, file-3 copy 2, etc.
2. strip parts of the filenames, either before, after, or exactly a certain string
3. smartly remove spaces and underscores, in order to detect misspelled names
4. group the resulting names, and smartly choose the most likely correct name among the group
5. sort the group according to the file created date
6. regenerate the sequence numbers for the group <-- Note this occurs on the whole group, regardless of the directory the file currently resides in
7. print the resulting changes to the filenames, and ask for confirmation
8. if the user confirms, apply the changes to the filenames
